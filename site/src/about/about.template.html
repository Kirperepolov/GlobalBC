    <h3>How it was started</h3>
    <p>
      While learning how to use AngularJS I decided to gather all the previously passed materials on JavaScript in one place with easy access to. For this I started my own Angular project with just two views:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the list of all the sessions I passed in GlobalLogic JS Basecamp;</li>
      <li>the links to all the learning and practicing materials regarding this sessions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Foreasmuch, I don't have my web-server with built-in database yet, I started preparing a JSON file with all the needed information manually. It's a long way to the top if you create jsons manually, so I just filled in the first session information and decided to create an admin view with a <a ui-sref="home.admin" target="_blank">form</a> for further information filling.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the preliminary site styling I've got an idea that it could be a nice pet-project with appropriate information <a ui-sref="aboutMe">about me</a>, links to my other works, links to my profiles in social networks and github and, ofcourse, my <a ui-sref="contact">contact information</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later than another idea came to me: I can to move some data to a free web-server, i.e. <a href="https://dashboard.heroku.com/">heroku</a>, and manage it with my admin form. I believe I can handle it, moreover, I have an example of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaakovchaikin">Yaakov Chaikin's</a> server application on ruby to start with.
